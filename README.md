# DSA
Data Structures and Algorithms (CSE310)

Playground for learning Data Structures and Algorithms, following "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.

Dynamic memory used as much as possible.

# Currently Implemented:

- Sorting Algorithms:
  1. Insertion Sort - O(n^2)
  2. QuickSort - O(n^2)
  3. Bubble Sort - O(n^2)
  4. Merge Sort - O(n logn)
  5. Heap Sort - O(n logn)
- Selection Algorithms
  1. Median Selection - O(n)
- Data Structures
  1. Stack
  2. Queue
  3. Heap (min and max)
  4. Disjoint Set (path compression)
